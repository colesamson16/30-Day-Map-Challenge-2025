# 30 Day Map Challenge – Day 24: Places and Their Names

## Theme
**Places and Their Names** – For this challenge, I mapped towns and cities in the United States that include an **animal** in their name.

## Data & Method
- **Data Source:** U.S. Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) and OpenStreetMap.
- Filtered for populated places (towns/cities) whose names contain common animal terms (e.g., Bear, Eagle, Fox, Wolf, Deer).
- Created using python, html, css and javascirpt.

## Map Concept
The map highlights:
- Geographic distribution of animal-themed place names across the U.S.
- Each point represents a town or city with an animal in its name.

## Why This Theme?
Place names often reflect local wildlife, history, or cultural significance. This map shows how animals have influenced naming conventions across America.

## Tools Used
Folium – For creating interactive maps with custom markers, layers, and controls.
Pandas – For reading and processing CSV data containing animal locations.
Base64 & io – To encode images for embedding directly into HTML popups.
Pathlib – For handling file paths in a clean, cross-platform way.
Folium Plugins:

Draw – Enables drawing shapes and exporting them.
MeasureControl – Adds distance and area measurement tools.
FeatureGroupSubGroup – Allows grouping markers by animal type for easy filtering.
Pillow (optional) – Used for resizing images before converting to Base64. If not installed, images are embedded at original size.
